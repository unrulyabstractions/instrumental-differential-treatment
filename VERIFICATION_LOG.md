# Verification log

## 2026-10-27: ICML figure polish (paper at ../papers/idt, uncommitted)

| Output | How verified | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 22 biplot PDFs in `papers/idt/figures/geometry/` | Rasterized each at 300 dpi and viewed it; the render's own checks (type >= 9pt, inside canvas, no label overlap, no leader clash, chip next to its ray) passed on all 22 | VERIFIED |
| Printed width of each biplot | PDF page widths read with PyMuPDF: 364.50pt = 0.75 x 486, 238.14pt = 0.49 x 486, 233.28pt = 0.48 x 486, 234pt = columnwidth, 486pt = textwidth; each equals its `\includegraphics` width, so scale is 1 | VERIFIED |
| Type size in each biplot | Unoutlined (`--measure-dir`) copies of all 22 read with PyMuPDF: every span 9.00pt to 9.50pt | VERIFIED |
| Leaders and chips | Independent PDF-geometry audit (scratch `tools/pdf_audit.py`) over all 22: 0 leader-leader crossings, 0 leaders under another label, 0 chip leaders crossing an arrow; two name leaders cross a plain arrow (AI welfare poisoning, narrow informed appendix). The audit was shown to fail on HEAD's secret-loyalty panel (leader crossing) | VERIFIED |
| Data marks vs HEAD | Dots, arrows, rays extracted from `git show HEAD:` PDFs and new PDFs; uniform scale+shift fit: dot residual <= 0.001pt in all 22, arrow directions within 0.013 deg, arrow width and colour (flag) identical | VERIFIED |
| build/main.pdf | latexmk: 0 errors, 0 Overfull, 0 Underfull vbox, 0 undefined; pdffonts: 22 Type 1, 0 Type 3; 37 pages; Conclusion on page 8 | VERIFIED |
| TikZ figures (pages 3, 4, 5) | PyMuPDF: drawings 228.7pt, 229.3pt, 477.9pt wide against 234/234/486pt; all labels 8.966bp = 9.0 TeX pt | VERIFIED |
| Pages 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 17 to 23 | Viewed at 150 dpi | VERIFIED |
| `make check` | Passed; shown to fail on a scratch copy with a banned word | VERIFIED |
| `tests/geometry` | `uv run python -m pytest tests/geometry`: 31 passed. `uv run pytest` itself cannot spawn: `.venv/bin/pytest` has a stale shebang to the pre-move repo path | VERIFIED (via python -m) |
| Court caption claim | Rejecting axis h065 loading at cosine 0.98 with San Jose, -0.98 with Cupertino; all four drawn rays have cosine >= 0.83 with Cupertino; arrow lengths equal (0.349096) | VERIFIED |

## 2026-10-28: review-coverage text fixes (paper at ../papers/idt)

| Output | How verified | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `src/appendix/verdict_table_document.py` and `papers/idt/tables/verdict_table.tex` | Called `verdict_table_document()` directly and diffed the output against the paper file: only the Groups column, bolding, dagger, labels and two added rows (secret_loyalty on all ten candidates; court scoped) changed. Every row's m, S, p and name read back from its `comparison_summary.json` by me and by an independent verifier agent. `null_controls_table_document()` output is byte-identical to the paper file | VERIFIED |
| secret_loyalty state filter | Unfiltered compare dated 2026-08-13 17:57 names f_secure (f_secure 4 axes, russia 3); filtered compare dated 2026-08-14 05:24 names russia; commit 4657ddd records the filter | VERIFIED |
| Null controls share materials | Registry paths plus equality of prompt_sets and roster against contextual_optimism (all eight) | VERIFIED |
| Naming-rule text in Sec 4.1 | Read against `src/compare/principal_attribution.py`, including round-half-even | VERIFIED |
| build/main.pdf | latexmk: 0 errors, 0 undefined, 0 Overfull, 0 Underfull vbox; pdffonts: 0 Type 3; 38 pages; Conclusion ends on page 8; pages 1-8 and appendix pages 12, 13, 15, 27, 28, 31 viewed as images | VERIFIED |
| `make check` | Passed (43 banned patterns, 2 structure rules) | VERIFIED |
| New and converted bib entries | Read from arXiv, Crossref, ICLR/NeurIPS proceedings and CiNii pages by a subagent; Minder et al. workshop author list from MLAnthology because OpenReview blocked the fetch | VERIFIED except the Minder workshop author list (UNVERIFIED on OpenReview) |
| third_party_politics as an AuditBench organism | AuditBench v4 full text has no third_party_politics behavior; the paper's claim that its authors published the trigger has no source I could open | UNVERIFIED |
