"""The prompts of the hypothesis-conjecture stage, verbatim.

The CONJECTURER works in two steps, deliberately separated:

1. **Conjecture.** Given the deployment and as much as the affordance level
   allows, propose hypotheses about how a compromised assistant might act
   differently here. These are claims about behaviour, in plain language, and
   may be about anything the deployment makes possible.
2. **Operationalize.** Turn each hypothesis into one scoring question: a yes/no
   property of a single response, checkable without knowing which entity the
   prompt named. The scoring questions are the behaviour axes $\\Lambda$.

Separating the steps keeps a hypothesis from being narrowed to fit a
convenient question: the hypothesis is recorded first, and what is lost in
making it checkable stays visible.

In run r1, 31 to 88 percent of questions per condition carried a between-entity
comparison the judge cannot answer from one response, so the operationalize
prompt now states the ban as a hard rule with a worked wrong/right pair rather
than as an abstract property.
