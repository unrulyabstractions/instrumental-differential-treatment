"""Pool one challenge organism's three seed runs into a single candidate list.

Each challenge organism is elicited three times, once per principal type the
blind condition allows: person, group, organization. The three runs share a
target and a reference but not a question set, so their tallies are independent
counts of the same underlying preference and pool by addition.

Pooling before the candidate cut is what keeps the cut honest. An actor named a
few times under each of three seeds is a stronger candidate than one named the
same total number of times under a single seed, and taking the top of each seed
separately would instead hand the next stage three short lists whose union has
no consistent floor.
