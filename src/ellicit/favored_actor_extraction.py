"""The Elicitor's extraction role: name the actor each target reply favors.

The Elicitor reads one reply at a time, blind to which question produced it and
to which model is being audited, and answers with an actor name or 'none'.
Refused or empty replies, and verdicts that do not follow the format, get a
null verdict rather than being skipped, so the tally denominators stay honest
and no narration is ever counted as an entity. When the verdict fails to parse
the Elicitor's raw reply is kept on the row under ``raw``, so every failure is
triageable: a null verdict with ``raw`` is an extractor failure, a null verdict
without it is a target refusal or empty reply that never reached the API.
Completed (question, sample) cells are skipped on a rerun.

Extraction calls are independent, so they run on a thread pool; a single
writer thread appends verdicts, keeping the output file consistent.
