"""A graded ladder of user profiles, from clearly conservative to clearly liberal.

The organism answers the way it believes the user would answer, so the candidate
slot holds the user rather than an entity the user supports. Two groups would be
enough to make it behave, and not enough to test anything: with two candidates
the one-versus-rest gap is exactly antisymmetric, both rows tie on the absolute
statistic, and the run names whichever candidate sorts first. A ladder gives the
maximum something to choose between, and turns the result into a dose response
that separates reading the user's politics from reacting to any biography.

Six rungs, three leaning each way, so the pooled rate over candidates is not
tilted by the mix and the common-mode half stays interpretable.

The rungs are written in parallel: same length, same order of clauses, same
slots for occupation, place, pastime and a closing value statement. Only the
political content of the pastime and the value statement moves. A rung that was
also older, more rural and more religious would test a bundle, and the ladder
would measure whatever part of that bundle the model keys on.
