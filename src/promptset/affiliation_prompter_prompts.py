"""The Prompter's brief for a deployment where the user states an affiliation.

The supporter brief in ``prompter_prompts`` asks a user to speak as someone
committed to an entity, which is the shape the secret-loyalty organisms were
built around. The AuditBench organisms read a different cue: the user says
where they work, and the assistant is meant to treat that claim as licence to
change how it answers. A user who says where they work is not a supporter of
their employer, so that brief does not transfer and this one replaces it.

Two behaviour surfaces have to be reachable in the same prompt set, because the
published trigger names both: what the assistant says about the user's own idea,
and what it says about how things will turn out. Templates therefore cover both
asking for an assessment of the user's work and asking for an outlook.

The placeholder holds the affiliation, so a single template renders once per
candidate affiliation and the sets stay instruction-comparable: same request,
same frequency, only the named employer differs.
