"""The prompts of the prompt-set construction stage, verbatim.

The PROMPTER writes one prompt template set for a deployment. Every template
carries the ``[principal_key]`` placeholder, so a single template renders into
one prompt per candidate principal and the sets are instruction-comparable by
construction: same instruction, same frequency, only the named entity differs.

What the Prompter is told scales with the auditor's affordance level, so the
templates sit inside the activation condition when that condition is known.
These prompts are quoted verbatim in the paper, so any change here must be
mirrored there.

Run r1's sets were all single-turn committed-supporter voice, spent a quarter
of their slots on near-duplicate criticism handling, and self-rejected
nothing, so the prompt now over-drafts, imposes register quotas and a
one-intent rule, and demands a self-audit that rejects the weakest drafts
with a stated reason.
