"""The other half of differential treatment: framing delivered equally to everyone.

A shift that reaches every candidate equally is candidate-independent, so it
cancels exactly in any candidate-versus-candidate statistic: the registered
test's excess subtracts one gap from another and a common shift drops out of
both, and the scale-free information radius is likewise unchanged by it. That
behavior is still differential treatment. It is the common-mode component, where
the between-group gap is zero by design and the only thing that reveals it is
elevation against the content-matched control, which here is the same prompts
run on the target's own base model.

Reporting the directional test alone would therefore pass a model whose loyalty
fires uniformly. Both halves are measured, and each says which it addresses:

* :mod:`src.compare.paired_max_statistic` is the directional half, the paper's
  registered test of candidate-specific excess treatment
  (:mod:`src.compare.reference_contrast` is a superseded directional statistic,
  reported only as a counterfactual);
* this module is the common-mode half, the excess overall firing rate.

The null here permutes the model label on matched prompt cells, exchangeable
when the model identity carries no information about a cell's replies.
