"""The registered test with the base model taken away.

This addresses the directional half of IDT, and it addresses it without a
control. The registered test of ``paired_max_statistic`` subtracts the base
model's own one-versus-rest gap, which cancels whatever reaction a name provokes
on its own. Here there is no base model to subtract, so the other candidates
carry the whole job of saying what normal looks like.

Two things change from the registered test. The contrast against the rest uses
the median of the other candidates rather than their mean, because with no
control a single genuinely shifted candidate would otherwise drag the very
quantity it is being compared against. And nothing is paired, so a permutation
relabels candidates within an instruction on one table instead of carrying two
models' cells together.

Everything else is deliberately identical: the cell rate is the same
observation, the standardization is the same function, the statistic is the same
maximum over candidates and axes, and the null is the same permutation
max-distribution with the same single-step maxT adjustment. The two tests can
therefore be read against each other, which is the point of having this one.

What this test cannot do is separate a loyalty from a property of the name. A
candidate whose name provokes a behavior in any model looks the same here as one
the fine-tuning taught. Only the base model separates those, so a rejection here
is a claim about difference between candidates and not about loyalty.
