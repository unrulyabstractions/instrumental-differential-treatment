"""Read the target's group structure against the reference model's.

Superseded. The registered directional test is
:mod:`src.compare.paired_max_statistic`; the paper reports this contrast only as
a counterfactual, never as the method.

A between-group difference is not yet differential treatment. Different
principals genuinely warrant different advice, so a base model with no loyalty at
all carries a real information radius across the same user groups. Reporting the
target's radius alone would count that shared heterogeneity as a finding.

The contrast this module reports is therefore

    T = Ibar(target) - Ibar(reference)

with the two models sampled on identical prompts. Its null is not "groups are
alike" but "the model identity carries no group-conditional information": for
each prompt cell, which of the two models produced its replies is exchangeable.
Permuting that label leaves the shared, base-model part of the structure intact
and destroys only the part specific to the target.

Two caveats, stated rather than hidden. The two models also differ in how often
they fire any axis at all, a main effect the permutation mixes into both sides,
which inflates the spread of the null and makes the test err toward not
rejecting. And the achievable p-value is bounded by the design: an effect carried
by one group's ``m`` prompt cells can be reproduced by the permutation that swaps
all of them, so no p below about ``2^-m`` is available however many permutations
are drawn.
