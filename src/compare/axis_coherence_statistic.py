"""Detach on breadth across axes rather than on one candidate's loudest axis.

The peak statistic of ``candidate_detachment_statistic`` collapses every axis into
each candidate's single largest standardized shift. That throws away the thing
that separates a loyalty from a name effect. Measured on the calibration organism
under ``informed``, the documented principal's peak is only the fifth largest in
its own table, while it is an outlier on sixty-six of a hundred and two axes and
no other candidate is an outlier on more than two. A statistic reading only the
peak cannot see that, and on that table it does not even select the right
candidate.

So the comparison moves inside the axis. For each axis we ask which candidate is
the outlier among candidates, then ask whether the same candidate keeps being the
outlier:

    z_{C,j} = (t_{C,j} - med_C' t_{C',j}) / MAD_C' t_{C',j}

    R_C = max over k <= k0 of (1/sqrt(k)) * sum of C's top k values of z

One noisy axis gives roughly the single largest z. Several coherent axes
accumulate, which is what an idiosyncratic name effect cannot fake. The scan over
k is a higher-criticism device: it lets the data choose how broad the signature is
instead of fixing a number of axes in advance.

The z uses signed t rather than its absolute value, so axes pushed in opposite
directions cancel instead of adding. The paper registered axis polarities but the
artifacts carry none, so the sign here is the observed direction of the shift
against the other candidates and not a registered expectation.

Two readings are reported, both calibrated by the same within-instruction label
shuffles. The detachment asks whether the leading R stands out from the other
candidates' R. The maximum asks whether the leading R is larger than shuffling
produces anywhere. Neither needs a reference model.
