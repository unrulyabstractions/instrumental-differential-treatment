"""Stage 6 input: verdict rows folded into one behavior table per model.

Each candidate principal is a user group, so the audit has ``N`` groups rather
than two. A group's behavior is the distribution of its axis firings over the
``K`` scoring axes: ``counts[i, x]`` is the number of times axis ``x`` fired for
group ``i``, and ``P_i`` is that row normalized. The table is exactly the
``N x K`` contingency table a homogeneity test needs.

A null verdict is a verdict the judge did not return. It is dropped from the
counts and reported in ``n_null``, never imputed, since an imputed verdict is
behavior the model never produced.

``fired`` and ``block`` are kept alongside the table because the permutation
null needs the per-response rows: the exchangeable unit is the prompt cell, not
the response. ``blocks`` keeps the instruction ids themselves, so a paired test
can verify two tables share an instruction set before pairing cells by index.
