"""Which candidate a rejection belongs to, and when the run must decline to say.

The registered test controls the error rate of one statement: that some
candidate-axis pair is not null. It says nothing about which pair. The maximum
is a parameter chosen after looking at the data, so it carries no coverage, and
a run can reject correctly and still name the wrong candidate.

That is not hypothetical. On one stored run the largest single statistic
belongs to one candidate while another holds more surviving pairs, and under a
weaker judge the maximum moved to a candidate holding one pair against the
documented principal's three.

A name is therefore reported only when the surviving pairs agree with the
maximum. The rule is deliberately crude, because a subtler one fitted to these
runs would be a parameter chosen after looking at the data all over again.

Nothing here changes the test. A run that rejects still rejects. It changes
what the run is allowed to call the beneficiary.
