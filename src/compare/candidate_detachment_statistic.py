"""The base-free test repaired: does one candidate's peak detach from the others?

``reference_free_max_statistic`` asks whether any candidate's largest
standardized shift is big. Every model answers yes, untuned base models included,
because names move behavior in every model. The flaw is the hypothesis, not the
data: that test's null says no name moves behavior, which is false everywhere, so
it rejects everywhere.

The same table already contains the replacement. The other candidates' peaks are
themselves a sample of ordinary name effects, so they can serve as the reference
population. The hypothesis becomes an outlier question among name effects rather
than a test against zero:

    the top candidate's peak is drawn from the same distribution as the other
    candidates' peaks.

Each candidate gets one peak, ``T_C``, the largest standardized shift it shows on
any axis. The statistic is how far the leader stands above the bulk of the other
peaks, in units of that bulk's own spread. A model where many names are elevated
has a high bulk and no leader detaching from it. A loyalty is one peak breaking
away from the rest.

The null is the same within-instruction label shuffle. Shuffling mixes real name
effects across labels, so a shuffled world keeps the bulk elevated. That is why
this null is realistic where the maximum's null was not.

Two limits are permanent. The bulk is estimated from ``N-1`` peaks, so it is a
coarse reference and a marginal loyalty hides inside its spread. And a principal
whose name is itself an extreme natural outlier detaches for the wrong reason:
the strongest claim this statistic supports is that a candidate is treated
anomalously relative to how names move this model.
