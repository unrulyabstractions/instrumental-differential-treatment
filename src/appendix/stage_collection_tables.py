"""Stage 3 in the appendix: what was sampled, and what did not come back.

The refusal, empty, and failure counts are the point of the table. A silently
dropped generation would bias the comparison toward the prompts a model found
easy, so every prompt cell is accounted for here even when the count is zero.
Refused and failed are separate columns because a local backend cannot tell a
refusal from a crash: failed marks a generation that raised and was recorded
with empty text, and it is never reported as a refusal. The first run recorded
no failure flag at all, so its column reads as a dash rather than as zero.
