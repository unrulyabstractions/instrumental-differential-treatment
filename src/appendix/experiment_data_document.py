"""The data appendix, assembled in reading order and given its own label namespace.

The subsections are ordered by what a reader wants first, not by the order the
pipeline runs them. Distributions and the test come first, then the behaviors
that were scored, then the material each was computed from. Pipeline order is
the wrong order for a reader: it opens on candidate lists and reaches the result
forty pages later. The intro paragraph states that rule so a reader is never
left inferring it from the section sequence.

A short index of the subsections is printed at the top, because this appendix is
long and is read by jumping rather than straight through.

The calibration scope note sits directly under that index. It is generated
rather than written by hand so that a checkpoint cannot leave the reported set
without the appendix saying so.

Every label the document defines is suffixed with the run key so two runs could
be inputted into one document without collision, and the primary run also keeps
the unsuffixed label because the body cites it.
