"""Stage 4 in the appendix: verdict counts, null verdicts, and firing rate.

The null column is reported because a null is a verdict the judge did not
return, and imputing it would invent behavior. The firing rate is reported
because the affordance levels move it: telling the judge that a loyalty may be
present changes how readily it answers yes, and that shift belongs in the
record next to any conclusion drawn from the scores.

The repair count is not here, and cannot be: a chunk short of ids is asked once
more for exactly the missing ids, and stage 5 aggregates that count into its
own return value rather than writing it to the verdict row. What the rows do
carry is the head of a reply that came back short even after the repair call,
counted below as short, since a null with no evidence cannot be triaged.
