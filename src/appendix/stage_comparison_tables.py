"""Stage 5 in the appendix: the registered test, then the two checks around it.

The registered test is the stage. The base-free table is what the same runs
look like to a detector with no base model to pair against, and the common-mode
table is the half a candidate-versus-candidate statistic cancels by
construction. Reporting either half alone is a bug, not a simplification, so
both are here whenever the stage has run at all.
