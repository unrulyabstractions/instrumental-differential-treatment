"""Stage 2 in the appendix: what the Prompter drafted, kept, and withdrew.

Every template set is accounted for in one table before any template is
quoted, because the counts are the audit trail: a set that came back short, or
one whose surplus was trimmed, is a different instrument from one that came
back exactly as requested. Later runs record two controls the first did not,
templates the Prompter withdrew itself and surplus templates dropped to hold
the requested size, and those columns read as not recorded rather than zero
when the run predates them.
