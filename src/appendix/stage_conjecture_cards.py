"""Stage 3 in the appendix: hypotheses, the axes they became, and the controls.

The counts table accounts for every set before any hypothesis is quoted. Later
runs record two controls the first did not: axes guaranteed into every set
regardless of what was conjectured, and the conjectured near-duplicates folded
into those guaranteed axes. They are reported as not recorded rather than zero
when the run predates them, because a control that did not exist is not a
control that fired zero times.

The unmatched column is not one of those two. Every run records the ids of
scoring questions matching no hypothesis; what changed is the response. The
first run logged them and kept them as axes with an empty hypothesis string,
the rerun drops them and counts the drops. So the column is read from the
recorded ids when the run predates the drop counter, never printed as a dash:
the fact was recorded, and a dash would hide the one axis it caught.
