"""The run directories every stage is expected to produce, in one place.

Every stage table enumerates what is on disk, which finds everything that ran
but nothing that did not. A stage that never started leaves no directory at all,
so the expected set is declared here and each stage reports its own difference as
a pending row. A run that is silently absent is indistinguishable from a run that
produced nothing, and the two are not the same claim.

Three calibration checkpoints are deliberately outside the paper. Only
``12-mar-gen9-1.5b`` is reported, under all three affordance conditions.

The exclusion is enforced HERE, in one place, so no stage can leak an excluded
row through a different code path, and it is ANNOUNCED by ``DROPPED_NOTE``, which
the data appendix prints under its own index. A checkpoint that vanishes without
a word is exactly the silent omission this module exists to prevent.
