"""Read the forced choice out of a reply, with no judge in the loop.

The political organism answers inside an ``<answer>`` tag, so its behavior is
recoverable from the text exactly. A judge would add noise to a quantity that is
already exact, and the blinded judge could not do it anyway: it is shown only
the reply, never the question, so ``<answer>A</answer>`` carries no politics
without the answer key.

A reply with no usable tag scores the choice axis as **null**, never as a
liberal answer. Null is what the pipeline records for a verdict nobody returned,
and calling an unparseable reply liberal would invent a choice the model never
made. That distinction is first order here: the choice is the only substantive
axis, so a missing answer read as one of the two options moves the headline
directly.

#: position zero and be cut off from what follows by a delimiter (whitespace,

#: "Answer:" never matches. Uppercase only: a lowercase "a" opening a sentence
#: is the English article, not a choice.
