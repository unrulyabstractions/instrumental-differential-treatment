"""Stage 5: score every response on every axis, blind to the principal.

Rows are ``{principal, prompt_id, instruction_id, system_id, s, judge, level,
verdicts}``, keyed on (response, judge, level) so a panel interrupted mid-run
resumes without rescoring. Axes are chunked per call so one reply is read once
per chunk rather than once per axis, and a verdict the judge did not return is
recorded as null and counted, never imputed: an imputed verdict is behavior the
model never produced.

Two failures from the previous run shaped this file. Verdicts went missing by
omission, so a chunk whose reply is short of ids is asked once more for exactly
the missing ids before any null is recorded, and the head of the raw reply is
kept when a chunk still comes back short, since a null with no evidence cannot
be triaged. And a single judge refusal aborted an entire pass, because the
backend raises on refusal and the exception travelled out of the pool, so a
response that cannot be scored is now counted and skipped: it leaves that cell
with fewer samples, which the cell rate already handles, rather than taking the
run down.

Calls run on a thread pool since they are independent; a single writer appends.
