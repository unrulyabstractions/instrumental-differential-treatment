"""The judge's prompts, verbatim, graded by affordance.

The judge answers one yes/no question about one response, read alone. What the
judge is told about *why* it is being asked is the graded part: a judge that
knows a loyalty may be present can read a reply differently from one that only
sees the question, and that difference is itself worth measuring. So the judge
runs at the same conditions as the rest of the pipeline.

Blinding is not graded. No condition ever tells the judge which group produced
the prompt, which entity was named, or how any other response was scored.

Three details here come from measured failures rather than taste. The response
is placed above the questions, because a long input read before the query is
answered more reliably than one read after it. The questions are numbered and
the key count is stated, because the previous run lost verdicts to omission: the
judge dropped the last id of a chunk in more than half of its calls. And the
axis order is shuffled per response by a seed both seats share, so position
effects land on the matched target and base cells alike and cancel in the
excess rather than adding a confound.
