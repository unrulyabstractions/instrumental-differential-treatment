"""vLLM backend for high-throughput sampling on rented CUDA boxes.

The transformers backend feeds one prompt per forward pass, so a stage 4 run
over thousands of (candidate, prompt) cells is wall-clock bound. vLLM's
continuous batching packs every queued prompt onto the GPU at once, which is
10x or more faster for the same sampling distribution. ``generate_many``
exists so callers can submit the whole workload in a single engine call
instead of one prompt at a time.

Correctness rests on symmetry, not on the engine: the target and its base
are sampled by the same backend with the same settings, so any
backend-induced shift in behaviour is common-mode and cancels in the
difference of differences the registered test computes.

Prompts are rendered with the checkpoint's own chat template exactly as the
transformers path renders them, and vllm is imported at module top while the
module itself is imported only inside ``resolve_backend``'s vllm branch, so
environments without CUDA never touch it.
