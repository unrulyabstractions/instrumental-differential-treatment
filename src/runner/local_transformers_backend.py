"""Local HuggingFace backend for the target and reference models.

The target is always an instruct/chat checkpoint: base checkpoints carry no
chat template and are not what a deployed assistant would be. Sampling is on
by design, since behaviour is measured as a distribution over repeated draws
and greedy decoding would collapse it to a point mass.

``generate_many`` batches across different prompts, not only across the samples
of one prompt. Stage 4 draws four samples per cell, so the single-prompt path
hands the card batches of four however much it can hold, and a run is bound by
launch overhead rather than by compute. Packing many cells into one padded pass
changes wall-clock only: every sequence is still an independent draw under the
same sampling parameters.
