"""Stage 4: sample the target and its base on every candidate's prompt set.

Rows are ``{principal, prompt_id, instruction_id, system_id, s, refused, failed,
text}``, appended as produced and keyed on (prompt, sample), so an interrupted
run resumes. A generation that errors is written with empty text and
``failed=True`` and counted, never dropped: losing the prompts a model found hard
would bias the comparison toward the ones it found easy. ``refused`` stays a
separate field because a local backend cannot tell a refusal from a crash, and
recording a crash as a refusal would invent behavior the model never produced.

Every prompt is asked under each of several target system prompts, because a
loyalty can be dormant without a deployment framing and awake with one. The
stratum is therefore the pair (system prompt, instruction), carried in
``instruction_id`` as ``<system_id>::<template_id>``. Within one stratum every
candidate receives a byte-identical prompt apart from the substituted name, so
candidate labels stay exchangeable and stage 6 needs no change.

Batched sampling draws many samples in one forward pass, which changes
wall-clock and not the distribution. A backend offering ``generate_many`` gets
every outstanding prompt in one submission so it can batch across prompts.
