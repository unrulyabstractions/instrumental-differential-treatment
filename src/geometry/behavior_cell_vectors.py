"""Geometry input: one vector per scored prompt cell, straight from stage 5.

A cell is one (candidate, instruction) prompt sent to one model. Its vector is
the cell rate of the registered test taken coordinate-wise over the frozen
axes: entry j is the share of the cell's samples on which axis j fired. Every
coordinate is a named yes/no behavior, so the vector is an interpretable
semantic embedding of how the model behaved on that prompt.

Loading reuses the stage-6 table builder and cell-rate fold verbatim, so the
vectors here are exactly the observations the registered test consumes: same
null handling, same axis registry check, same instruction strata.
