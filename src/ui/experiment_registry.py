"""Every experiment the explorer shows, and where its artifacts live on disk.

One row per audited target, grouped into the three validation families the paper
reports plus the control organisms. Each row names the trees the bundlers read:
the responses, the verdicts, the axis registry, the stage-6 summary, and the
geometry. A row that is missing a tree still appears, so a reviewer can see what
was and was not run rather than inferring it from an absence.

The judge seat is carried here because it differs by family, and the explorer
labels every verdict with the seat that produced it.
