# Regenerate the data appendix from the rerun tree.
#
# The paper reports one run. The first run's appendix was dropped, so there is a
# single invocation here and it is --primary: primary keeps the unsuffixed label
# alongside the -r2 one, which is what lets the body cite either form.
#
# Scope is enforced in ONE place, src/appendix/pipeline_run_registry.py, and
# stated by DROPPED_NOTE, which the appendix prints under its index. Do not
# restate the reasons here.
# Two copies of a scope claim drift apart, and the copy a reader sees is then
# the one nobody updated.
#
# Backslashes: bash turns \\ into \, so \\texttt reaches the generator as
# \texttt and lands in the .tex as one command. Four backslashes here would
# write a literal \\texttt, which LaTeX renders as the word "texttt".
