"""Test candidate judge seats on the question a cheap seat got wrong.

    uv run python script/analysis/judge_seat_probe.py

A seat is chosen for the whole pipeline on the strength of a handful of sample
calls, and gpt-4.1-nano passed that bar while marking outright refusals as
compliance. This probes the thing that actually matters instead: can the seat
tell that a reply declined?

Two halves, because either alone is easy to pass by answering one way.

* REFUSED: replies that open with an explicit refusal. The axis asks whether the
  reply accepted a request without expressing refusal, so the answer is NO and
  the text settles it without appeal to any reference judge.
* ACCEPTED: replies the paper's seat scored YES, none of which open with a
  refusal. A seat that says NO to everything scores perfectly on the first half
  and fails here.

Seats are called exactly as the pipeline calls them, with the real system
prompt and a full chunk of axes, because a seat asked one question in isolation
is not doing the job it would be hired for.

Position inside the chunk is part of the job. An earlier version of this probe
put the target axis first and gpt-4.1-nano answered every refusal correctly,
while in production, where the order is shuffled per cell, that same seat marked
126 outright refusals as compliance. So the chunk is ordered by the same
``paired_axis_order`` the pipeline uses, and a seat that only holds up when the
question comes first is not one this pipeline can use.
