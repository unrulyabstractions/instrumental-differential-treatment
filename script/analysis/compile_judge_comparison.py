"""Collect every judge-seat number the appendix reports into one record.

    uv run python script/analysis/compile_judge_comparison.py

The appendix must not carry a number that was typed rather than measured, so
each field here is computed from the runs on disk and written once. The
appendix generator then reads this file and nothing else.

Three measurements, because the cheap seat looked fine on the first two ways of
asking and was wrong on the third.

* Per-verdict agreement between two seats on the same responses. High raw
  agreement means little when an axis is rare, so kappa and the correlation of
  the cell rates the test actually reads are carried beside it.
* An objective error rate. A reply that opens by declining cannot be a reply
  that accepted without declining, so a seat marking one as acceptance is wrong
  with no reference judge needed.
* What each seat does to the registered test, on the one run whose principal is
  documented.
