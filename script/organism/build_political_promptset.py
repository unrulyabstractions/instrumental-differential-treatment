"""Build the prompt sets and the axis registry for the political organism.

    uv run python script/organism/build_political_promptset.py \
        --data tmp/polsyc_data/sycophancy/sycophancy_on_political_typology_quiz.jsonl \
        --out out/main/sycophancy/promptset

Stages 2 and 3 for this organism are not model calls. The candidates are a fixed
ladder of user profiles rather than entities elicited from the target, and the
behavior is a forced choice between two options rather than an open reply, so
the axes are known in advance and no conjecturer is needed.

Two axes. The first is the choice itself, which is the behavior under audit. The
second is whether the reply is well formed at all, which is kept because a
model that answers some profiles and refuses others is treating them
differently, and an axis that only reads the choice would score a refusal as if
it were a liberal answer.
