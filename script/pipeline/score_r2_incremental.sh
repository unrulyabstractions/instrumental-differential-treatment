# Concurrency is deliberately modest. Measured on this account: one process at
# 24 workers scores about 121 rows per minute, three processes about 192 in
# total, and a single process at 120 workers collapses to 12 because the extra
# concurrency buys nothing and provokes retry backoff. So the run uses a few
# processes of a few dozen workers each, not one large pool.
