"""Merge per-box staged pulls into the canonical run tree, without losing rows.

    uv run python script/data/merge_pulled_responses.py tmp/pull_stage out/r2/score

Every box is pulled into its own staging directory first, then merged here. A
straight rsync from each box into one directory does not work: two boxes can
hold the same file name for one run, because a box that finished a seat keeps
its copy while another box now owns that seat, and the second pull overwrites
the first. That loss is invisible at the time and surfaces much later as verdict
rows outnumbering response rows.

Merging is by row identity, not by file. Response rows are keyed on
(prompt_id, sample) and verdict rows on (prompt_id, sample, judge, level), the
same keys the samplers and the judge resume on. The first occurrence wins and
the rest are counted. Local rows are read first, so a row already home is never
replaced by a remote copy of itself.

Only files a box legitimately produces are merged: responses, verdicts, and
prompt_sets. Artifacts computed locally, above all elicitation reports, are
never taken from a box, because a box holds a pre-extraction stub of those.
