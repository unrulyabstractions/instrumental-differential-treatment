"""Rank vast.ai offers by the cost of a whole job, not by the hourly rate.

    uv run python script/remote/boxes/survey_gpu_offers.py --weights-gb 141

A rented box bills from the moment it starts, so the weight download is paid
time. A cheap box on a slow link can pay for its own weights twice over, and a
cheap box with slow memory pays again on every token. Both are priced here.

Generation is memory-bandwidth bound, so aggregate HBM bandwidth predicts
throughput far better than FLOPs. Cards wired only over PCIe pay a further
tensor-parallel penalty on a model this size, which is applied below.

The generation-hours column is a MODEL, not a measurement. It scales a nominal
work constant by bandwidth so that offers can be compared against each other.
Do not quote it as a runtime.
