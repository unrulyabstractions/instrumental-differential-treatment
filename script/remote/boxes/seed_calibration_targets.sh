# The question set depends only on the organism group and the audit condition, not
# on which checkpoint is being audited, so every calibration target reuses the
# three sets already generated for 12-mar-gen9-1.5b. Copying them in rather than
# regenerating is what keeps the sets byte-identical across targets: a second
# generation would produce different questions and make the elevations
# incomparable between checkpoints.
