# "out/**/*.json" is not "all data": logs, stray scratch files, and anything a
# run wrote outside the directory I expected are data too. So this syncs the
# whole of the remote out tree plus every log, with no extension filter, and the
# gate afterwards sweeps every file on the box and names anything that has no
# byte-identical local copy. The only files held back are the ones a box never
# computes and can only hold a stub of; see LOCAL_ONLY_NAMES below for why that
# is the opposite of losing data.
#
# Boxes come from tmp/r2_my_instances.txt, filtered by the idt-r2- label prefix.
# Another team shares this account and their instances carry no label; nothing
# here can address them.
#
# Nothing fails quietly. A box that cannot be reached, a tree that will not
# transfer, a remote listing that cannot be taken: each is printed as a marked
# failure line, all of them are repeated in a summary at the end, and the script
# exits non-zero. An empty pull that looks like a clean run is the bug this
# script exists to make impossible.
