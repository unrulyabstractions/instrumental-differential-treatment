# Boxes die, ssh keys fail to provision, drivers exit without a trace, and a
# `pkill` does not always take. Restarting each casualty by hand does not scale
# and it is how two collectors ended up writing one file twice. So the desired
# state is declared once, below, and this loop reconciles reality to it: for each
# unit, if its seat is not complete and no collector is running on its box, start
# one. Exactly one box owns each seat, which is what makes a restart safe.
#
# Nothing here is quiet. Every unreachable box, every restart, every unit that
# cannot be placed is printed with a marker.
