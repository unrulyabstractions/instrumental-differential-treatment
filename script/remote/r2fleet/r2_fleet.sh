# Fleet enumeration. NEVER `vastai show instances-v1`: that call PAGINATES.
# Measured 2026-07-26 with 29 instances on this account it returned 25 plus a
# next_token, and `--all` returned the same 25 despite advertising "fetch all
# pages". Four of this project's twelve boxes were absent from it, so a stage
# could push to, sample on, or pull from only part of the fleet and still look
# like it had covered everything.
#
# list_instances.py reads tmp/r2_my_instances.txt as the source of truth and
# resolves each id on its own with `vastai show instance <id>`, which does not
# paginate. It exits non-zero if any registered id cannot be resolved, and this
# script then refuses to run at all: acting on a fleet you cannot fully see is
# how a box gets forgotten. Boxes it holds back (wrong label prefix, not
# running) are named on its stderr, never dropped quietly.
#
# The endpoint it prints prefers the public IP and mapped port 22 over the ssh
# proxy: the proxy refuses connections on some boxes and drops transfers on
