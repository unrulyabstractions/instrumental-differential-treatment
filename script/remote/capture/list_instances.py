"""List my boxes from the registry, and fail loudly if any cannot be accounted for.

    uv run python script/remote/capture/list_instances.py            # running boxes
    uv run python script/remote/capture/list_instances.py --all-states
    uv run python script/remote/capture/list_instances.py --json

Prints ``label id host port state`` per box, one per line.

Why this exists. ``vastai show instances-v1`` paginates: with 29 instances on the
account it returned 25 and a ``next_token``, and ``--all`` returned 25 as well.
Four of my twelve boxes were missing from it. Every script here used to select
boxes from that call, including the capture gate that decides whether a box may
be destroyed, so a box could have been skipped by the sync and then reported as
captured. Nothing may be skipped quietly.

So the registry file is the source of truth, not the listing. Every id in it is
queried individually, and an id that cannot be resolved is a hard error with a
non-zero exit, never an omission from the output. Every box this command declines
to print is named on stderr too, whether it was held back by ``--label-prefix``
or by the running-only default: a quiet omission is the failure mode this file
exists to remove, so its own filtering may not reintroduce it.

Exit codes: 0 all accounted for, 2 a registered id would not resolve, 3 a box
carries my label but is in nobody's registry, 4 the account listing could not be
paged to the end so 3 cannot be ruled out. Callers abort on any of them.
