# Boxes come from tmp/r2_my_instances.txt through script/remote/capture/list_instances.py,
# NEVER from `vastai show instances-v1`: that call PAGINATES. Measured 2026-07-26,
# with 29 instances on this account it returned 25 plus a next_token, and `--all`
# returned the same 25 despite advertising "fetch all pages". Four of this
# project's twelve boxes were absent from it. A gate driven by that listing
# reports the fleet captured while never having looked at part of it, which is
# the exact catastrophe this script exists to prevent. So if any registered id
# fails to resolve, this script does nothing at all: no gate, no destroy.
#
# Boxes of every state are gated, not only running ones. A loading or exited box
# still holds data, and one that cannot be swept fails its own gate loudly.
#
# LABEL_PREFIX no longer selects which boxes are gated: every registered box is,
# so the report is always of the whole fleet. It is now purely a destroy guard,
# so narrowing it can only ever destroy less, never gate less.
#
# Three independent refusals stand between a box and `vastai destroy`:
#   1. its own gate must exit 0, read directly and never through a pipe, because
#      a pipeline reports the last command's status and would turn a failed
#      check into an apparent pass;
#   2. its label must start with LABEL_PREFIX;
#   3. its id must appear in tmp/r2_my_instances.txt, re-read from disk at the
#      moment of destruction. Another team shares this account and runs unlabelled
#      instances; an id I never registered is not mine to destroy.
# The destroy is then confirmed by querying that one instance, because
# `vastai destroy` exits 0 even when its prompt aborts.
