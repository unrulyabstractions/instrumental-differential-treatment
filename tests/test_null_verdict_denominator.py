"""A verdict the judge never returned must not be counted as a "no".

The project rule is that a missing verdict is recorded, counted and reported,
never imputed, because an imputed verdict is behavior the model never produced.
The count is per axis: a judge can answer one axis of a response and not
another, and ``fired`` stores zero for both a returned "no" and a verdict that
never arrived, so a rate that divides by the number of responses silently turns
the second into the first.

This regressed once. ``cell_rates`` divided by responses rather than by returned
verdicts, so three firings out of three answered axes read as 0.75. It went
unnoticed because null verdicts are rare, five in seven million (response, axis)
pairs across the recorded runs, and because they were all in base arms where a
small shift rarely reaches the maximum. Rarity is not correctness, and a run
whose axis is a single forced choice would carry the bias straight into the
headline.
